### run.sh â€” This script readies and executes the PARS SvxLink node. You are
### Not expected to use this script directly. It should be executed via the
### ENTRYPOINT declarative in the Dockerfile.
###
### If $ENV is set to 'dev' then this script will make SvxLink call out its
### ID every 45 seconds by inputting *#
###
### Usage:
###   ./run.sh
###

# Checks if the required environment variables are set or raise a bad exit
[[ -z "$ECHOLINK_CALL" ]] && { echo "ECHOLINK_CALL is not set" ; exit 1; }
[[ -z "$ECHOLINK_PASS" ]] && { echo "ECHOLINK_PASS is not set" ; exit 1; }
[[ -z "$AUTH_KEY" ]] && { echo "AUTH_KEY is not set" ; exit 1; }
